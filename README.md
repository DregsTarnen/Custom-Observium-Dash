# Custom-Observium-Dash
Utilizes AJAX, php, and Observium API to create a quickview board for alerts. 
Device assets appear and dissapear from screen when added or taken away from Observium. Using divs you can group items.
OK! This is a rough piece, and by rough I don't mean it doesn't look beautiful because it looks good, what I mean is the script could be sharpened up. I thought I would share it because when I made our first dashboard with Grafana I was looking for something like this that I could tweak myself. I never found anything, so here is to the tweakers and meddlers, Enjoy!. Our personal board also has the ability to change background color if a Broadcast Storm Alert is triggered. I could add that portion of the code if asked.
